# Stock Price Tracker

A React application that tracks stock prices and provides visual alerts when a stock rises above 10% or falls below 10% of its initial value.

## Features

- Display current stock prices from static data
- Visual indicators for significant price changes
- Dashboard overview of multiple stocks
- Detailed view for individual stock performance

## Installation

```bash
